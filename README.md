This example demonstrates a common error when using the MongoDB $inc operator. If the field to be incremented does not exist, it will be created with a value equal to the increment, which may lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption in certain scenarios. The solution shows how to use $setOnInsert to handle the case gracefully.
